#### **Exploring Primordial Black Holes in the Early Universe: _My PhD Research_**

I recently completed my PhD thesis focusing on **primordial black holes (PBHs)**â€”fascinating objects that could have formed in the early universe and might potentially account for some portion of _dark matter_. Using **numerical relativity (NR)**, I investigated how these ancient black holes might have formed and evolved, particularly in a _matter-dominated early universe_.

---

#### **Key Findings**

My research demonstrated that sufficiently large **density perturbations** in the early universe could collapse to form PBHs through two distinct mechanisms:

- **Direct collapse:** Where the heaviest perturbations immediately form black holes.
- **Accretion collapse:** Where lighter perturbations trigger a process that pulls in surrounding dark matter.

I developed an **analytical framework** to predict which mechanism would occur for a given perturbation and calculated how quickly these collapses happen. Interestingly, regardless of the formation path, these primordial black holes initially form with relatively _small masses_ compared to the cosmic horizon, but then undergo **extremely rapid growth**.

#### **Spinning Black Holes**

I also investigated the formation of **spinning primordial black holes**, finding that about _10% of mass and angular momentum_ transfers during the formation process. However, my simulations suggest that unless the matter-dominated era was brief, these black holes would likely **lose most of their spin** as they accreted non-rotating matter from their surroundings.

---

#### **Computational Advances**

Given the **computational intensity** of these simulations, I developed methods to reduce the computational requirements through **dimensional reduction techniques**. These advances allowed for stable numerical evolution of specific scenarios like **vacuum bubble collisions** during first-order phase transitions.

_This post is a simplified overview of my doctoral research. I plan to expand on these topics with more detailed explanations in future posts._
